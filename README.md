Stop AutoPlay on SoundCloud

When you are open SoundCloud and if you are not logged in - sometimes SoundCloud starts to plays some shitty music.
As we can suspect - it's paid promotion.

To skip this shitty playing we need to turn off autoplay in the playlist, which is turning "on" by default.

Purpose of this extension is to turn off autoplay on each time when SoundCloud opened.
